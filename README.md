# Project 1: Storm Viewer :heavy_check_mark:
A simple app that lets users scroll through a list of images then select one to view. 
> Get started coding in Swift by making an image viewer app and learning key concepts.

# Project 2: Cows and Bulls :heavy_check_mark:
A game that will let generate a random hidden number with 4 unique digit from 0 to 9, and the player has to guess the hidden number. If one of their digits is in the correct place it’s a “bull”, if it exists in the hidden number but is in the wrong place it’s a “cow”. 

> Practice your List skills while learning about random numbers and text input.

## Project 2 Extention :heavy_check_mark:
As one of the challenges of project 3; Views and Modifiers; the result text should show different colours depending on how close the user is:
- Red for 0 bulls 0 Cows
- Yellow for 1 to 3 bulls and cows
- Green for 4 bulls and/or cows

Hard mode does not show any colour.

# Project 3: Views and Modifier :heavy_check_mark:
A lesson on how and why Views and Modifiers work that way in SwiftUi.

> Dive deep into Swift's rendering system.

**Challenge:** Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.

# Project 4: Text Parser :heavy_check_mark:
A command line project that will analyses text input using the natural language library as well as the swift-argument-parses library. 

> Tackle the command line with Swift Package Manager and the NaturalLangugae Framework

# Project 5: MultiMap :heavy_check_mark:
An app that lets us search for and track multiple locations at the same time. 

> Learn to create maps and map pins by combining SwiftUI and MapKit.
